<li><a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/-/media/faculty/raghuram-rajan/research/papers/paper-on-banking-sector-reforms-rr-va-final.pdf">Indian Banks: A Time to Refrom ?</a> This paper is authored by the famous Indian Economist Raghuram Rajan. He's talking about the state of govt owned banks in India. The reaons as to why they've been a loss making entity for a very long time and what steps could be taken to mitigate that in the future. </li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adam-Smith/The-Wealth-of-Nations">Wealth of Nations</a> I've read a few chapters from this book. The author doesn't use language that is out of reach of anyone who knows English but <code>Boy this Book is Heavy</code>. Now, before I'm "categorized" I don't think Adam Smith was a corporate loving, government hating billionare and neither am I. I think he was just noting how early trade was developing and noted down a few thoughts and I've enjoyed reading some of those thoughts.</p>

<li><p>The Intelligent Investor: I like the idea of deplying capital wisely. I do like the innocence with which Warren Buffet talks about things. This book will feel very very dry if this is the first book you're reading a about investing but develops over time.</p>
