To tell the model what is focus on the attention mechanism is going to return a weight. This weight is going to be a number between 0 and 1 and the pixels with higher weight attached to it are supposed to be the pixels the model should focus on. \n",

To predict each word the model uses attention to state which part of the source sentence should be focussed on. \n",

So, if the model has outputted 3 words in french it is supposed to represent the sequence of those 3 words. But, more importantly it is supposed to tell the attention mechanism which word we want to predict next. Here, I would like to take a moment to talk about how to think about this variable in more abstract terms and I'd like to argue that the purpose of the attention mechanism is to query information from a list of vectors. When I'm translating something, I'm querying \"Which part of the source sentence I should focus on to predict the next word?\" or when I'm generating a caption I'm querying \"Which part of the image I should focus on to predict the next word?\".

We've already discussed how attention tells us which things to focus on in a list of entities. It does that by returning a weight for each item in my list. Higher the weight means an entity is more important. So, `encoder_outputs_attention_weights` represents weights for each item in `encoder_outputs`. Now, here's an important property for the weights attention returns. In all the implementations of attention that have been invented yet this property is gonna hold true. The weights are always gonna sum up to 1 and this gives me the opportunity to state that these scores are normalized.\n",

However, self-attention is for a reason a little different than that. In 2017, the researchers at Google published a research paper detailing a new architecture that they had invented and this architecture had self-attention as a core component. This architecture is called `The Transformer`. The invention of this architecture was something of a watershed moment (even though it feels like they happen every other day in the Deep Learning field). This standalone model is really powerful and the performance of this models on a whole host NLP tasks has been truly awesome. \n",
